Announcement for Students Placements and research innovation
We have prepared more than 20 GB of study material, including 1,000+ code examples, covering 35 subjects related to the new AI course and Robotics.
ðŸ“š Some notes are already available in Google Classroom, and students can start studying from there.
ðŸš€ Soon, we share the entire collection with the public     

OPEN SOURCE LIFETIME!. SOON 1000 CODE (AI,ML,DL,NN and NLP) WILL PUBLISH.
